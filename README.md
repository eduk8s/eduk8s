November 2021 Update:

Educates, formerly eduk8s, was created as an internal tool at VMware to support the work of a team of developer advocates who needed to train users in using Kubernetes. The former proof of concept is now a product under the VMware Tanzu portfolio known as Learning Center for Tanzu Application Platform. Therefore the Educates Github will no longer be updated and will soon be deprecated.
