# The "resources" directory is currently a copy of the corresponding
# directory from the "eduk8s-operator" repository for the referenced
# version of the operator.
#
# This configuration then overrides the tag for the version of the
# "eduk8s-operator" container image used, as well as the image pull
# policy.
#
# When updating this file to bind to a specific version of the eduk8s
# operator for a new release you need to refresh the copy of the
# "resources" directory, and then update the version tag corresponding to
# the container image to use, by setting the "newTag" property.
#
# This overrides the default behaviour of the deployment resources which
# will otherwise use the "develop" tag for the container image.
